# Bootstrap Version Notes

## Component Differences
- Modals: Bootstrap modals don't have built-in placement options like Shoelace drawers
- Tooltips: Must be initialized with JavaScript in Bootstrap
- Custom Properties: Bootstrap 4.5 has limited CSS custom property support

## Setup Requirements
- Requires jQuery and Popper.js
- Bootstrap JS components need manual initialization
- SCSS variables use `$` prefix instead of CSS custom properties
